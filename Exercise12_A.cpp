/* ex_memleak.cpp -- lab12 exercise program
*
* This programs has classes Point and Triangle. Triangle consists
* three points. which are reserved separately from dynamic memory.
* Therefore Triangle has three pointers to Points. Memory for the
* Triangle itself has also been reserved from the dynamic memory.
*
* Program can generate an exception at the Nth Point constructor call.
* N is now 4 which means that all those three Points (in Triangle) can
* be created.
